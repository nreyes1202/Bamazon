# **Bamazon**

## Amazon-like storefront for your needs.

###### This app displays a variety of items when node is run in the terminal, with each one having a certain quantity available. The first prompt asks the customer which item they'd like to purchase by typing the item ID number from the displayed table. Next, the customer is prompted about the quantity that they'd like to purchase. If the quantity is less than or equal to the stock quantity, then the customer will receive a prompt stating that there are enough stocked items. Therefore, the purchase will be completed. If the customer's quantity exceeds the stocked quantity, the customer will see a prompt of insufficient quantity. The order will not proceed in that case. Finally, when the order is completed as a result of having enough stocked quantity, the customer will see the total price of their order.

###### The database used for this app is MySQL. When the customer completes a purchase, the new quantity will be reflected in the prompt as well as the database.

## Happy shopping!
